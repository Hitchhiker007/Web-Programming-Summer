                    <h2>What Is Wellness?</h2>
                    <p>Wellness is a modern word with ancient roots. 
                        The key tenets of wellness as both preventive 
                        and holistic can be traced back to ancient civilizations 
                        from the East (India, China) to the West (Greece, Rome). 
                        In 19th-century Europe and the United States, a variety of intellectual, 
                        religious and medical movements developed in parallel with conventional medicine. 
                        With their focus on holistic and natural approaches, self-healing and preventive care, 
                        these movements have provided a firm foundation for wellness today. 
                        Wellness-focused and holistic modalities have gained more visibility 
                        since the 1960s/1970s under the writings and thought leadership of an 
                        informal network of US physicians and thinkers (such as Halbert Dunn, Jack Travis, 
                        Don Ardell, Bill Hettler, and others). As these have evolved, proliferated, 
                        and gone mainstream, they have informed the healthy-living, self-help, self-care, 
                        fitness, nutrition, diet and spiritual practices that have become a 
                        flourishing wellness movement in the 21st century.</p>

                    <h2>Defining Wellness</h2>
                    <p>The Global Wellness Institute defines wellness as the active pursuit of activities, 
                        choices and lifestyles that lead to a state of holistic health.</p>
                    
                    <p>There are two important aspects to this definition. 
                        First, wellness is not a passive or static state but rather an 
                        “active pursuit” that is associated with intentions, 
                        choices and actions as we work toward an optimal state of health and wellbeing. 
                        Second, wellness is linked to holistic health—that is, 
                        it extends beyond physical health and incorporates many different dimensions 
                        that should work in harmony.</p>

                    <p>Wellness is an individual pursuit—we have self-responsibility 
                        for our own choices, behaviors and lifestyles—but it is also significantly 
                        influenced by the physical, social and cultural environments in which we live.</p>

                    <p>Wellness is often confused with terms such as health, 
                        wellbeing and happiness. While there are common elements among them, 
                        wellness is distinguished by not referring to a static state of being 
                        (i.e., being happy, in good health, or a state of wellbeing). 
                        Rather, wellness is associated with an active process of being aware and making 
                        choices that lead toward an outcome of optimal holistic health and wellbeing.

                    <h2>Wellness Is Multidimensional</h2>
                    <p>Wellness is about more than just physical health. 
                        Most models of wellness include at least six dimensions 
                        (and sometimes up to 9 or 12):
